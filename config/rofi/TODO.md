# Rofi Todo

[Source](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)

* [x] A config for `Mod+Space` that gives the ssh, file, and other multi/combo options
	* [x] Can we include custom menus in the `combi`/mode-switch?
		* WE CANNNN
* [ ] A power menu?
* [ ] A favourites list/menu
* [ ] An icon specific theme/style/config for selecting between icons like a power menu or audio controls
* [ ] `Alt-Tab` `rofi -show window` & then custom `alt-tab` to change selection
* [ ] A nice selector to open ssh mode, regular run mode, and other custom ones
* Steal some of `~/.config/rofi/rofi/scripts/launcher_t4`'s homework
