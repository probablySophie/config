# Sway TODO

Alternatively... do none of this and stick with KDE.

## Setup/Install

* [ ] Get backgrounds working/settings
	* [ ] Alternate images from a set folder like `~/Pictures/Backgrounds` or `~/Pictures/Desktops`?
* [Running programs natively under wayland](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/Running-programs-natively-under-wayland)

## Find

* [ ] A screenshot GUI like KDE's Spectacle
* [ ] A network manager (`nm-applet`?)
* [ ] A bluetooth manager
* [ ] Something that plays well with touchscreens

## Fix

* [ ] Fix the weird issue that was happening with the calculator ([fix?](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki#my-favorite-application-isnt-displayed-right-how-can-i-fix-this))
* [ ] Can we add `caption="Picture-in-Picture"` or `captionNormal="Picture-in-Picture"` to floating in `./config.d/custom_app_rules.sh`?
